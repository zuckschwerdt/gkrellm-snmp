TODO / WISHLIST:
================

Do you want/need
 monitor multiple oid's on the same server? (snmp bulk get)
 charts instead of krells?
 SNMP v1, v2, v3 support?
 SNMP privacy options?

 Enter peer, port, community and oid in separate fields
 or as snmp://community@peer:port/oid ?

 other SNMP lib instead of UCD-SNMPD ?
 GKrellM pre 0.9.8 support/compatibility?

 instance mapping?

Very nice ! I wonder if it would be possible to 
receive SNMP notifications (a.k.a traps) ?
The actual SNMP trap could be written to syslog
and only an indication of a received trap could
be visible.

For example, it would be cool to be able to
define a text, for example: XYZ, which is
displayed in the GKrellM monitor. When a 
SNMP trap is received, the text chould change
color and/or start to flash. When the user
notice this he checks his syslog output.

-> candidate for some next release
   trap message could be viewed as bubble help (popup).

I just figured I'd throw you a few suggestions that I think would be nice
for your gkrellm snmp plugin:

Configurable update delays (it looks like you were planning to put this in
but didn't have it completed for this release)
->Done

Putting the default snmp port in the port field would be nice for those
of us who are forgetful and don't have any other fields in (I always have
to grep snmp /etc/services :)
-> Done

A divisor would be nice, too.  For example, I'm monitoring interface usage
on a router and the fields are given in bits/sec--It'd be handy if I could
divide the result by 1000 and get the kilobits/sec as this would take up
less room.
-> Todo, a variable auto divisor is already there.

Though I don't usually need them, I noticed that re-reading the config file
will break if the descriptive text has a space in it.

It'd also be nice to have a max limit that could be set either by hand or
by a an snmp oid and then putting a krell (like underneat the 
cpu/proc/disk/interface graphs) on the field.
