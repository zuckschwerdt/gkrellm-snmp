GKrellM_SNMP FAQ:
=================

The libcrypto is part of OpenSSL.
Which libs is libsnmp compiled against?
Try `ldd /usr/lib/libsnmp.so` YMMV
Mine is compiled staticly -- so I don't need to link against any lib.

There is some broken hardware and some ASN.1 types aren't implemented, yet.
Please report the offending OID's and I'll see if there's a workaround
possible.

Try to change the name of my function. Run

    mv gkrellm_snmp.c gkrellm_snmp.c.orig
    sed -e 's/snmp_parse_oid/my_snmp_parse_oid/g' gkrellm_snmp.c.orig >gkrellm_snmp.c
