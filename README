gkrellm_snmp: GKrellM SNMP monitor Plugin
Author:    Christian W. Zuckschwerdt <zany@triq.net>
Homepage:  http://triq.net/gkrellm/


A plugin for GKrellM, that let's you monitor SNMP vars.


Prerequisites:
===============
You need a SNMP library to run this plugin.
You also need the header (include) files for building.
Tested with UCD-SNMP >= 4.1 ( http://ucd-snmp.ucdavis.edu/ ).
(If you want to try -old- CMU-SNMP or UCD-SNMP <= 4.0, please be so kind
 and mail some feedback).

The UCD-SNMP project is know as NETSNMP now. If you have NETSNMP installed
please try "make netsnmp" and let me know if it works.

This means for e.g. Redhat (7.1) you need to install ucd-smp as well as
ucd-snmp-devel!

Compiling:
===========

* For linux: just run the normal 'make'.
* For freebsd: run 'make freebsd'.
* To use NETSNMP run 'make netsnmp'.


Installing:
===========
Running 'make install-user' will place the plugin in your current home
directory under ~/.gkrellm2/plugins.
Running 'make install' as superuser will place the plugin under
/usr/lib/gkrellm2/plugins. You can also manually place the resulting
gkrellm_snmp.so under ~/.gkrellm2/plugins. After restarting gkrellm, you
should be able to enable it in the gkrellm plugins configuration menu.


Troubleshooting:
================
If you have trouble compiling the plugin. Make sure you have gtk 2 and 
gkrellm >= 2.0.0 and you've installed the gkrellm header files in
/usr/include/gkrellm or /usr/local/include/gkrellm. If you have placed the
header files in some other dir, edit GKRELLM_INCLUDE in the Makefile

 
Bugs:
=====
No GKrellm 1.x support anymore. Anyone needing that?
I do consider this version stable.
please mail any problems/bugs to me...


Some example:
=============

(1)

The ambiente temperature sensor for Oldenburg i.O., Germany
(see http://www.PMNET.uni-oldenburg.de/temperatur.php3)
is world readable

 Peer: 134.106.172.2  Port: 161  Community: public 
 OID: extOutput.1 (= .1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.8.1.101.1 from UCD-SNMP-MIB)

If you have the needed MIB you can use the symbolic OID from. The name
is unambiguous but only available if you have the MIB installed.

(2)

Server CPU load using a string ranging from 0.00 to 1.00
(e.g. the load factor for the first cpu on PMNET's Stan )

 Peer: 134.106.120.1  Port: 161  Community: public
 OID: laLoad.1 (= .1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.10.1.3.1 from UCD-SNMP-MIB)

(3)

Server CPU load using integer variable ranging from 0 to 100
(e.g. the percentile load for the first cpu on PMNET's Kyle)

 Peer: 134.106.172.2  Port: 161  Community: public
 OID: laLoadInt.1 (= .1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.10.1.5.1 from UCD-SNMP-MIB)

(4)

Most devices don't support gauges for interface load. They just count
octets. You can get around that limitation with the delta monitoring
feature. (eg. monitor packet counters instead of gauges)

 Peer: 134.106.172.2  Port: 161  Community: public
 OID: ifInOctets.1 (= .1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.10.1 from RFC1213-MIB)
 or OID: ifOutOctets.1 (= .1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.16.1 from RFC1213-MIB)
Be sure to check the button "Delta".

You can convert the symbolic OID to numbers and vice-versa with
snmptranslate:

$ snmptranslate -m all -IR laLoadInt.1
.1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.10.1.5.1

$ snmptranslate -m all -OnS .1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.10.1.5.1
UCD-SNMP-MIB::laLoadInt.1


More interessting OIDs:
=======================
- Chasis inlet temperature (tested on cisco7204VXR)
  CISCO-SMI::ciscoMgmt.13.1.3.1.3.1
 .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.13.1.3.1.3.1

- Dominik Winter found the following OID's in Cisco's Vendor-MIB
  (works for his cisco-2514 w/ IOS Version 11.2(5))

  locIfInBitsSec.n  inbound traffic measured in bit/s
  .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.2.2.1.1.6.<interface_nr>

  locIfOutBitsSec.n  outbound traffic measured in bit/s
  .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.2.2.1.1.8.<interface_nr>

  locIfInPktsSec.n  inbound traffic measured in pkts/s
  .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.2.2.1.1.7.<interface_nr>

  locIfOutPktsSec.n  outbound traffic measured in pkts/s
  .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.2.2.1.1.9.<interface_nr>

  avgBusy1  CPU-load sampled over 1 minute
  .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.2.1.57

  avgBusy5 CPU-load sampled over 5 minutes
  .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.2.1.58

Where <interface> means the number of the interface you wish to monitor.
Be aware that software routers are likely to have this setup
 ifDescr.1 = lo0 ; ifDescr.2 = eth0 ;ifDescr.3 = eth1
So if you mean eth0 you need to write "2"!

Be always sure to prepend the leading dot "." it's much like the
root "/" in path names.
Mostly there is a trailing ".0" do not omit it -- it selects the first
row (E.g. there could be more that just one value).
You can specify the cpu or interface appending a .1 or .2 and so on.


Call for features!
==================

Do you want/need
 monitor multiple oid's on the same server? (snmp bulk get)
 choose between charts and krells?
 SNMP v1, v2, v3 support?
 SNMP privacy options?

 Enter peer, port, community and oid in separate fields
 or as snmp://community@peer:port/oid ?

 other SNMP lib instead of UCD-SNMPD / better NETNMP support?
 GKrellM pre 1.x or 0.x support/compatibility?

 instance mapping?

 Diffential monitors (eg. monitor packet counters instead of gauges)?


Please help:
